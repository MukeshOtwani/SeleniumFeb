1- You can have n number xml file
2- You can have only 1 xml and within that xml you can seperate the test suite
3- I just need to run failed scenario

	Fix each and every test- run them
	Fix every scenario and run as suite again
	
	testng-failed.xml- This xml will have information about failed scenario


CrossBrowser Test- With seq, With Para

Parallel- Make sure that test are independent > Test Suite should be independent

Maven Surefire Plugin- This is only used for testing phas

clean- delete target folder

install- Install all dependency if any missing + it will run the test + generate reso (war,jar,tar etc)
